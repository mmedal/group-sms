# Group SMS

This application provides group SMS messaging. It is useful for group coordination where internet connectivity is unreliable or low-bandwidth. It was developed for coordination of backpacking trips in the mountains of Colorado. It is inspired by IRC and [GroupMe](https://groupme.com/en-US/sms).
